# Mini-Project-3
Android/React Native App

Building the app in Android Studio was an interesting exercise, and I kind of wish we had started with this, instead of the 
twitter app mini project, since this was far more scaffolded for app beginners. (I hadn't ever built an app of any sort
before this course, and the twitter assignment felt a bit like being thrown in the deep end.) That said, I'm not sure that the 
process Android Studio takes you through to build that first simple app really leaves you capable of building an actual app
that does more than the basic things covered in the tutorial. It almost seems like the tutorial is more about teaching you
where to find various features of Android Studio than how to build an app using Java (or Kotlin).

Although React Native talks about building an app for Android (and using Android Studio to do it), I find it far too confusing. 
I suspect that the result is worth the struggle to understand what the tutorial is trying to say, if one plans to launch one's
app on both Android and iOS, as it looks like one can write the app's code once and launch on both platforms. However, even the 
tutorial is very user unfriendly. (To be fair, I tended to work on React Native once I got home, and my medication had generally
worn off by the time I'd started, so that might have played a role in my difficulties with it.)
